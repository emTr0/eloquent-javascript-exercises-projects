# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises & Projects
A repo for all of the exercises and projects I worked on while reading the book "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke. [Get the book on Amazon](https://emtr0.link/eloquentjs).

Each exercise or project may include a comment with a line or two from the book's instructions to help identify the purpose of the program.
